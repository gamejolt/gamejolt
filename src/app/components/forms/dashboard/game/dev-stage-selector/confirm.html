	</p>

	<ul>

		<!-- Ratings -->
		<li ng-if="$ctrl.from == 'devlog'" translate>
			People will now be able to rate your game (unless you turn it off in your Settings).
		</li>
		<li ng-if="$ctrl.action == 'wip:complete'" translate>
			Your early access ratings will be archived and we will show a separate rating average for your complete game page.
		</li>
		<li ng-if="$ctrl.action == 'complete:wip'" translate>
			Your complete game ratings will be archived and we will show a separate rating average for your early access game page.
		</li>
		<li ng-if="$ctrl.to == 'devlog'" translate>
			Ratings will be disabled for your game. Any ratings you currently have will be archived until you transition back to an early access or complete game page.
		</li>

		<li ng-if="$ctrl.from == 'devlog'" translate>
			Public packages/builds for your game will now be visible to everyone.
		</li>
		<li ng-if="$ctrl.to == 'devlog'" translate>

		</li>

		<!-- Devlog Tab -->
		<li ng-if="$ctrl.from == 'devlog'" translate>
			Your game's devlog feed will be moved into its own tab. You can continue posting devlog posts for your game.
		</li>
		<li ng-if="$ctrl.to == 'devlog'" translate>
			Your game's devlog feed will move back to your game's main page.
		</li>

			Your game will be added to the top of the "new game" list.
