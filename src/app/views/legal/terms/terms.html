Each time you access, view or use the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use (these "<strong><em>Terms</em></strong>"), which may be amended from time to time. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide each user of the Service with notice of any amendment to these Terms, and we also will provide notice on the Service of any amendment to these Terms. Any amendment only will apply to your use of the Service on and after the date of the amendment. In addition, if you use or purchase any product or service through the Service, you also will be subject to any terms and conditions applicable to that product and service. If you do not agree with these Terms, you immediately should stop using the Service.</p>
<p>We reserve the right, at any time and from time to time, to modify or discontinue the Service or terminate your access to the Service with or without notice, charge fees in connection with the use of the Service, modify or waive any fees charged in connection with the Service, and offer opportunities to some or all users of the Service.

The Service is owned, operated and maintained by Game Jolt from the United States of America, and Game Jolt does not represent or warrant that the Service is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. You choose to access, view or use the Service on your own initiative and at your own risk, and you are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations.</p>
<h3 id="our-service-generally">Our Service Generally</h3>
<p>We endeavor to provide users of the Service with access to certain specialized content and services relating to video games and other products and services. We do not review, screen, edit or monitor all of the information or content submitted to the Service or make judgments about such information or content. While we attempt to provide useful information and content on the Service, you acknowledge that the information and content we use is reliant upon third-party data and contributions (such as contributions by independent video game developers or other users), that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that such information may be incomplete or may contain inaccuracies and that information on the Service may be outdated or contain errors, omissions or misinterpretations of information. Any person's access to or use of the Service is not an endorsement of that person by us or a guarantee of that person's identity, quality, pricing or availability.</p>
<p>We make no warranty as to the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any such information. You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of any information you obtain from the Service before using such information. You agree to be solely responsible for your use of the Service and any information available through the Service.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise provided in a written agreement between Game Jolt and you, <strong><em>the Service and any information, products, or services made available through the Service are provided on an "AS IS," "AS AVAILABLE" and "AS MODIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME" basis</em></strong>. We will not be held responsible or liable for timeliness, removal of information, failure to store information, inaccuracy of information or improper delivery of information.</p>

<h3 id="product-requirements">Product Requirements</h3>
<p>Your use of the Service and any product or service available through the Service (collectively, the "<strong><em>Game Jolt Services</em></strong>") requires a compatible computer, Internet access (fees may apply) and certain software (fees may apply), and may require obtaining patches, updates or upgrades from time to time. Because your use of the Game Jolt Services involves hardware, software and Internet access (high speed Internet access is strongly recommended), your ability to use the Game Jolt Services may be affected by these factors. You are responsible for being aware of any particular system requirements of any specific product or service available through the Service and for your ability to meet such requirements, which may change from time to time. Applicable system requirements at the time of purchase may or may not be found on the information page for each product or service. It is your responsibility to learn the system requirements prior to purchasing any product or service through the Service. Physical copies of products are not available. If you are having difficulty downloading a product or encounter any other issues with the purchase, download or activation of a product or service, you should contact us at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:contact@gamejolt.com">contact@gamejolt.com</a>.</p>
<h3 id="your-registration-obligations">Your Registration Obligations</h3>
<p>To use the Service or certain parts or enhancements to the Service, you may be required to have a user account (your "<strong><em>Account</em></strong>"). In order to create an Account, you must be an adult and have the legal capacity to enter a contract in the jurisdiction where you live. If you are under the age of 18, your parent or legal guardian must create the Account, and consent to your use of the Service. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to use the Service or to create an Account.</p>
<p>You agree to provide accurate information when establishing and updating your Account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and keeping it secure, and you will be responsible for all usage of your Account and user name, whether authorized or not authorized by you. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Account, user name or password. In addition, you agree that you will never use another user's Account.</p>
<p>When you purchase a product or service through your Account, you may receive a unique download page. You will not, directly or indirectly, disclose the unique URL for your download page to anyone else or use anyone else's download page. You are solely and entirely responsible for all activities that occur on your download page. Game Jolt will not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorized use of your download page.</p>
<p>We will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the unauthorized use of your Account. However, you may be liable for our losses or the losses of others due to such unauthorized use. Although we have confidence in our security policies, their effectiveness relies upon your adherence to these Terms.</p>
<p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate or suspend your Account if we believe, or have been notified by a third party of its belief that, you may be infringing the rights of others, violating the copyrights or trademarks of others or engaging in any inappropriate behavior. We also reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate your access to all or part of the Service or to any product or service available through the Service for any reason or no reason, with or without notice. In the event of termination, your Account will be disabled, and you will not have access to your Account. You should be aware that, if your Account is terminated, we may not be able to grant you access to any purchased content or return your content to you, and that you may not otherwise have access to your content, although residual copies of such information may remain in our system for back-up purposes and for compliance with legal reporting obligations.</p>
<h3 id="payment-and-delivery">Payment and Delivery</h3>
<p><strong>Prices and Taxes.</strong> The price that you will pay for any product or service purchased through your Account will include the price of the product or service plus any applicable sales, use, value added or other taxes in effect on the time of purchase that Game Jolt is required to collect. Game Jolt may change prices and availability of products and services at any time. Game Jolt does not offer, and is not obligated to give, any refunds, price protection, or price matching in the event of a price reduction after your purchase of any product or service through the Service. If Game Jolt does not charge you for any applicable sales, use, value added or other taxes, you will not be relieved from your obligation to pay such taxes, and you must pay to the applicable taxing authority any taxes that may be due as a result of your purchase through your Account.</p>
<p><strong>Payment Processors.</strong> The Service may use Stripe, PayPal, Amazon Payments or other third-party payment processors as may be indicated on the applicable purchase page. You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use the payment method you provide to us or our payment processor, including, without limitation, any credit card you provide when completing a transaction. You agree to pay for all products and services that you purchase through the Service, and you hereby authorize Game Jolt to charge your chosen payment method for any products and services purchased and for any additional amounts due with respect to your Account (including, without limitation, any applicable taxes and late fees). Charges to your selected payment method will occur at the time of purchase. If you use the services of a third-party payment processor, you will be bound by that third party's terms and conditions, which are available on that third party's website. Game Jolt may change the payment methods offered at any time. All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service must be accurate, complete and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred.</p>
<p><strong>Electronic Signatures.</strong> Your use of the Service includes the ability to enter into agreements and/or to make purchases electronically. <span class="initialism">YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS CONSTITUTE YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY SUCH AGREEMENTS AND TO PAY FOR SUCH PURCHASES. YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS APPLIES TO ALL RECORDS RELATING TO ALL TRANSACTIONS YOU ENTER INTO ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NOTICES OF CANCELLATION, POLICIES, CONTRACTS AND APPLICATIONS.</span> To access and retain your electronic records, you may be required to have certain hardware and software, which are your sole responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery of Products.</strong> On occasion, technical problems may delay, interrupt or prevent the download or activation of the product or service that you purchased through the Service. Your exclusive and sole remedy with respect to any product or service that is not downloadable or able to be activated within a reasonable period will be limited to either (a) the replacement of such product or service, (b) store credit, or (c) a refund of the purchase price paid, as determined by Game Jolt in its sole discretion. Game Jolt will have no liability for issues encountered with downloading, activating or using products or services due to factors beyond Game Jolt's control, including, without limitation, your computer's performance and the speed of your Internet connection.</p>
<p>Some products and services still may be in development when you purchase them. You understand that product or service release dates may be delayed and that release dates and times posted on the Service only are estimates. You will not be entitled to any refund for a delayed product or service release date. Our obligation to deliver any product or service to you will be complete at the time and place you first receive the information necessary to commence download or activation of such product or service. In all circumstances, it is your responsibility to ensure that a product or service is correctly and completely installed on your computer. Once a product or service is purchased and you receive the product or service, it is your responsibility to keep the product or service from being misplaced, damaged or destroyed, and Game Jolt will have no liability to you in the event of any loss, damage or destruction.</p>
<p><strong>No Ongoing Obligations.</strong> Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, Game Jolt and its licensors reserve the right, without any liability to you, to change, suspend, remove or disable access to any product or service sold or made available through the Service at any time without notice. You understand that nothing in these Terms entitles you to any future updates, versions or enhancements to any product or service (although Game Jolt may offer such updates, versions or enhancements at its sole discretion).</p>

<p><strong>Refund Policy.</strong> All sales on the Service are final. Certain restrictions apply to sales of products and services sold or made available through the Service that might not otherwise apply to physical goods. Game Jolt does not offer refunds unless there is a defect in the product or service itself that prevents you from launching the product or service, and in such cases the refund period will be limited to 3 days following your purchase. Refunds will not be issued due to your dissatisfaction with the product or service or if your computer does not meet the minimum product or service requirements. Refunds will be issued <strong>solely</strong> at Game Jolt's discretion. If you think you qualify for a refund, please email us at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:contact@gamejolt.com">contact@gamejolt.com</a>.

<p>These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. The provisions of the U.N. Conventions on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to these Terms. Except as provided in the section entitled <em>Binding Arbitration</em> below (and claims proceeding in any small claims court), you agree that any claim, legal proceeding or litigation arising in connection with your use of the Service, your Account or any product or service obtained through the Service will be brought exclusively in or near Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in or near Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. You are responsible for compliance with all local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>
<h3 id="binding-arbitration">Binding Arbitration</h3>
<p>(a) Arbitration Procedures. You and Game Jolt agree that, except as provided in Section (d) below, all disputes, controversies and claims related to this Agreement (each a "Claim"), shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the "JAMS Rules") and under the terms set forth in this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Binding Arbitration Section and the JAMS Rules, the terms in this Binding Arbitration Section will control and prevail.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise set forth in Section (d) below, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and we will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator's decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator's findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator's decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) you and Game Jolt may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator's decision shall be final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.</p>
<p><span class="initialism">BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND GAME JOLT WAIVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</span></p>
<p>(b) Location. The arbitration will be conducted in King County, Washington, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances.</p>
<p>(c) Limitations. You and Game Jolt agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between Game Jolt and you individually. <span class="initialism">YOU AND GAME JOLT AGREE THAT (A) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (C) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.</span></p>
<p>(d) Exceptions to Arbitration. You and Game Jolt agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Claim seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Game Jolt's intellectual property rights; (ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such court's jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.</p>
<p>(e) Arbitration Fees. If you initiate arbitration for a Claim, you will need to pay the JAMS arbitration initiation fee. If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the JAMS Rules.</p>
<p>(f) Severability. You and Game Jolt agree that if any portion this Section is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section (d)), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section (d) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither you nor Game Jolt will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section (d) found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within King County, State of Washington, United States of America, and you and Game Jolt agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

You hereby agree that Game Jolt would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that we are entitled, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as we may otherwise have available to us under applicable laws.</p>
