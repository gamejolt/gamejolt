						<h4 class="text-center">Revenue Share</h4>

						<p>Developers in the program will show appreciation for your hard work by sharing 10% of revenue with you on sales resulting from your videos/streams! Mmm, 10% profit spells “pumpkin spice latte”, and it has your name on it.</p>

						<h3>How does it work?</h3>

						<p>As a partner, you will be able to generate a referral link for any paid game in the partner program. Simply use that link in your video description, or while streaming. Any purchase resulting from that link gives you 10% of the sale.</p>

						<p>Gamers will be presented with a message prior to their purchase letting them know the game is part of the Game Jolt Partner Program. They will be aware that a portion of the revenue will go to you as a partner, as well as the developer.</p>

						<h3>Who should sign up?</h3>

						<p>
							<app-jolticon icon="youtube" />
							<strong>YouTubers</strong> must have at least 50,000 subs and an average of 3,000 views per video.
						</p>

						<p>
							<app-jolticon icon="twitch" />
							<strong>Twitch streamers</strong> must have at least 3,000 followers. If you're a Twitch partner, we'll automatically make you a Game Jolt partner.
						</p>

						<p>
							<app-jolticon icon="mixer" />
							<strong>Mixer streamers</strong> must have at least 3,000 followers. If you're a Mixer partner, we'll automatically make you a Game Jolt partner.
						</p>

						<p>If you don't meet these requirements, but would like to be considered, apply anyway!</p>

						<h3>I'm a dev. How do I add my game to the program?</h3>

						<p>If it's a new game, you will be presented with the option to include it when you add your game to the site.</p>

						<p>If it's an existing game, you will have to opt it in. Simply go to your <router-link :to="{ name: 'home' }">Dashboard</router-link>, click to manage your game, click <strong>Details</strong> on the left, and you will see the option to include your game into the program.</p>
