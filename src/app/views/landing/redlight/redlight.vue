							<br />
							<h4 class="sans-margin-top">What is Redlight?</h4>
							<p>
								Game Jolt Redlight is a system that enlists the community's help in choosing new
								games to be released on Game Jolt. Publishers and AAA studios upload their games to
								seek a critical mass of community support in order to get selected for distribution.
							</p>

							<br />
							<h4 class="sans-margin-top">Who should submit their games to Redlight?</h4>
							<p>
								AAA studios and non-indie publishers looking to expand their audience to niche indie
								gamers.
							</p>

							<br />
							<h4 class="sans-margin-top">
								I know of a game that should be on here? What do I do?
							</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>
									Publicly tweet at the developers/publishers until they add their games to
									Redlight.
								</li>
								<li>Repeat this process on several different accounts.</li>
							</ol>

							<br />
							<h4 class="sans-margin-top">
								There's a game on Redlight that I really want to see succeed. What can I do?
							</h4>
							<p>Go tell your friends; be super annoying about it.</p>

							<br />
							<h4 class="sans-margin-top">What about non-game Software?</h4>
							<p>Games only. So don't try to upload your desktop application.</p>

							<br />
							<h4 class="sans-margin-top">What do I need in order to submit my game?</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Create a Game Jolt account</li>
								<li>Set up your marketplace account</li>
								<li>Upload your game</li>
								<li>
									Add
									<code>#redlight</code>
									to your game page description
								</li>
							</ul>

							<br />
							<h4 class="sans-margin-top">Are there any restrictions on what can be submitted?</h4>
							<p>You must have distribution rights for the game.</p>

							<br />
							<h4 class="sans-margin-top">How can I get more votes for my game?</h4>
							<p>
								Pay influencers to talk about it constantly. Make sure they include the Redlight
								link at the beginning, middle, and end of their videos. And in their descriptions.
								And in their twitter bios.
							</p>

							<br />
							<h4 class="sans-margin-top">
								How are games ranked on Redlight? How will I know if my game gets redlit?
							</h4>
							<p>
								It's a completely new and unique system. Games are ranked by the number of up-votes
								from the community. Once your game is submitted, you will receive an e-mail at the
								address associated with your account, notifying you when Redlit.
							</p>

							<br />
							<h4 class="sans-margin-top">
								I have specific questions about selling on Game Jolt and taxes/VAT.
							</h4>
							<p>
								<router-link :to="{ name: 'landing.marketplace' }">
									Visit gamejolt.com/marketplace
								</router-link>
								for questions about selling on Game Jolt and taxes. If you don't find an answer
								there, email us. We'll just direct you to the forums.
							</p>

							<br />
							<h4 class="sans-margin-top">Does Redlight cost money to submit to?</h4>
							<p>
								For the initial months, we've decided to waive the $5,000-$10,000 submission fee.
								We'll continue discussing this internally to see if we should add a few extra zeros
								in there. This is obviously for QA reasons. Only people who make good games have
								money.
